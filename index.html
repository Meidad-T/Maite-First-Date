                <p>Dear Maite,</p>
                <p>You are invited to our first date!</p>
                <p>I am beyond excited to finally get to meet you. From all our conversations over text and on the
                    phone, it is clear that you are literally the girl version of me while I am the guy version of you,
                    and that is rare to find.</p>
                <p>From the very first moment I have laid my eyes on you, I immediately felt it in my stomach... No
                    silly, not that - the good feeling.... I don't want to say too much yet, since the more I say now,
                    the more likely I am to scare you... but if my plans will work out, we should have forever for me to
                    tell you every single detail. But for now, what you should know is that you have captivated me from
                    the very first moment, and I am beyond thankful we got to meet.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Okay, enough of that... time to plan a date! So, you are hereby invited for
                    our first date! (of many to come).</p>

                <p><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, February 15th, 2026</p>
                <p><strong>Time:</strong> 3:00 PM CST</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Stone Oak Park.</p>
                <p class="sub-text">[Exact location within the park will be given sunday in advance, as I will get there
                    muchhhh earlier to set it all up.]</p>

                <p><strong>Clothing:</strong> Nothing fancy...</p>
                <p class="sub-text">[in fact, wear clothes you don't mind getting some paint on]</p>

                <p><strong>What to bring?:</strong> Your adorable self, your beautiful smile, your sweet laugh, and ofc
                    your brilliant mind.</p>
                <p class="sub-text">[In case you are wondering, I don't really know when the date will "end" per say...
                    it purely depends on how long we wish to stay but if its up to me, it will never end.]</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 30px;">If you have further questions, please let me know! I planned for this date
                    for many many hours so I truly hope all the components come together and work out well.</p>
